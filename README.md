## Overview

Welcome to our Sudoku project, a beautifully crafted implementation of the classic logic game. Our Sudoku application is built with Next.JS and styled with Tailwind CSS. It's deployed on the Vercel platform, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. Notably, our project does not rely on any external APIs for its functionality, offering an authentic and self-contained Sudoku gaming experience.

## Development Process - From Python to Next.JS

1. **Universal Backtracking Algorithm**: Our journey began with the development of a universal backtracking algorithm in Python. This algorithm is capable of solving Sudoku puzzles of any level of difficulty, including the most challenging ones.

2. **Sudoku Generator**: To test the effectiveness of our solution algorithm, we implemented a Sudoku puzzle generator in Python. The solution algorithm verifies the puzzle's validity, ensuring a rewarding and genuine Sudoku experience.

3. **Transition to TypeScript**: We transitioned our codebase from Python to TypeScript, setting the stage for the development of the web application.

4. **Development with Next.JS**: The web application was built using Next.JS, offering a robust and scalable platform for Sudoku enthusiasts.

5. **Dynamic Graphic Interface**: Our Sudoku application boasts a dynamic and visually appealing interface, bringing every move and decision to life.
